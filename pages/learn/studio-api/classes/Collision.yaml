name: Collision
type: classes
summary: |
  When your game objects start moving in your Unity game, you'll want them to interact with each other, and that's where the Collision class comes in handy. A Collision occurs when a moving object hits another object. The Collision class contains all the details about that collision, such as the velocity of the collision, the object hit, and the exact point the collision happened.

  This class is packed with a variety of properties reflecting different aspects of a collision event. Whether you need to know the force behind the collision or the components attached to the collided object, these details are all at your fingertips provided by the Collision class.

  The most common use of this is during "OnCollision" events that can be found in the Class.LuaBehaviour documentation. For more info, visit the [Unity's Collision Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision.html).

properties:
  - name: impulse
    summary: |
      The 'impulse' property gives you the total impulse applied by the physics engine to simulate the collision. This measurement helps gauging the "impact" of a collision. More details in [Unity's Collision.impulse Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-impulse.html).

    type: DataType.Vector3
  - name: relativeVelocity
    summary: |
      The 'relativeVelocity' property provides the relative linear velocity of the two colliding objects. It's a handy property that could be used for determining the speed of the collision. Visit [Unity's Collision.relativeVelocity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-relativeVelocity.html).

    type: DataType.Vector3
  - name: rigidbody
    summary: |
      The 'rigidbody' property refers to the Rigidbody component involved in the collision. Useful for manipulating the physical properties of the collided object. Check the [Unity's Collision.rigidbody Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-rigidbody.html).

    code_samples:
    type: Class.Rigidbody
  - name: body
    summary: |
      The 'body' property behaves much like the 'rigidbody' property providing reference to the body of the collided object. Refer to [Unity's Collision.body Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-body.html).

    code_samples:
    type: Class.Component
  - name: collider
    summary: |
      The 'collider' property references the Collider involved in the collision. This is especially useful when you need to access or manipulate the properties of the Collider during a collision event. Visit [Unity's Collision.collider Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-collider.html) for more details.

    type: Class.Collider
  - name: transform
    summary: |
      The 'transform' property allows you to access the Transform of the collided object, providing potential manipulation of its position and rotation during collision events. Refer to [Unity's Collision.transform Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-transform.html) for more.

    code_samples:
    type: Class.Transform
  - name: gameObject
    summary: |
      The 'gameObject' property grants access to the GameObject involved in the collision. This can be useful for applying game logic based on the GameObject that was hit during the collision. More details in [Unity's Collision.gameObject Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-gameObject.html).
    description:
    is_static: false
    code_samples:
    type: Class.GameObject
  - name: contactCount
    summary: |
      The 'contactCount' property tells you how many individual points have come into contact during the collision. This is helpful in determining the extent of the collision. Learn more in [Unity's Collision.contactCount Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Collision-contactCount.html).
