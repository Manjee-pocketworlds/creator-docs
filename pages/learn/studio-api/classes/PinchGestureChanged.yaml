name: PinchGestureChanged
type: classes
summary: |
  For those times when you need to interact with touch-enabled screens in your application, this class is a data container for the start of a pinch or drag gesture, usually used for operations like zooming, panning, or scaling. 

  It keeps track of various details of a pinch or drag gesture such as the change in position, start position, current position, direction, distance covered in the pinch, the scaling factor, and whether a pinch is currently happening. All these properties provide critical information to accurately detect and process pinch gestures for accomplishing sophisticated touch interactions.

  It is primarily used in the Class.Input class an the PinchOrDragBegan event's parameter.
