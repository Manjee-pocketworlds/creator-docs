name: CapsuleCollider
type: classes
summary: |
  The CapsuleCollider is a type of collider within Unity that takes the shape of a capsule - think of a common pill shape. It's beneficial when creating elongated spherical objects where a SphereCollider doesn't quite fit and a BoxCollider wouldn't feel natural.

  These colliders are essential for detecting collisions between GameObjects, allowing you to script specific reactions upon those incidents. They can be added to any GameObject and their size and dimensions can be modified to fit the shape of the GameObject accurately.

  To learn more about how to use CapsuleColliders, check out [Unity's CapsuleCollider Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/CapsuleCollider.html).

properties:
  - name: center
    summary: |
      The 'center' property signifies the center position of the CapsuleCollider relative to the GameObject's position. By adjusting this value, you can move the Collider away from the GameObject's center. To get a better understanding, you can refer to the [Unity's CapsuleCollider.center Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/CapsuleCollider-center.html).

    type: DataType.Vector3
  - name: radius
    summary: |
      The 'radius' property alters the CapsuleCollider's size in terms of its radius, the "distance from the center to the skin of the capsule." This could be used to expand or contract the Collider. For more insights, you can check [Unity's CapsuleCollider.radius Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/CapsuleCollider-radius.html).

  - name: height
    summary: |
      The 'height' property refers to the CapsuleCollider's vertical dimension. Modifying this will stretch or shrink the height of the collider. Check [Unity's CapsuleCollider.height Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/CapsuleCollider-height.html) for more details.

  - name: direction
    summary: |
      The 'direction' sets the axis along which the 'height' of the Collider extents. May hold one of three values, "0" for X-axis, "1" for Y-axis, and "2" for Z-axis. Visit [Unity's CapsuleCollider.direction Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/CapsuleCollider-direction.html) for more information.
