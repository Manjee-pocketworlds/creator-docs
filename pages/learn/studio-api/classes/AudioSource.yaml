name: AudioSource
type: classes
summary: |
  Consider a DJ set, where the music is prepared and played to the audience. In Unity, an AudioSource is like a DJâ€™s deck. By assigning an AudioClip to an AudioSource, you can control when a specific sound plays, how loud it plays, and even how it changes as it moves around in a 3D environment. 

  The AudioSource class further enhances audio playback with a variety of properties such as 'volume' for adjusting the loudness of the clip, 'pitch' to change the speed of the sound playback, 'clip' to hold the AudioClip data and 'loop' to replay the sound continuously. You can also check whether the audio source is currently playing with the 'isPlaying' property or if it is set to 'mute'.

  There are more advanced controls available such as spatial blending for a 3d sound effect, handling stereo panning with 'panStereo', specifying playback points in an AudioClip using 'time' and 'timeSamples', and the control to ignore sound effect processing using 'bypassEffects'.

  AudioSource is integral to sound control in your Unity applications, yielding a high degree of flexibility in manipulating audio outputs. To learn more about AudioSource, you can check out the [official Unity AudioSource documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html).
