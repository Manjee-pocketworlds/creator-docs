name: Texture3D
type: classes
summary: |
  The Texture3D class in Unity is your toolbox for handling three-dimensional textures, think of it like a cube filled with colored pixels instead of a flat square or rectangle like regular 2D textures. It's particularly useful when you want to create effects like volumetric fog, 3D noise, or store data for use in shaders that need more than two dimensions. Just like how a normal texture has a width and height, a Texture3D has an additional 'depth' dimension that adds a third layer of data. Imagine a stack of 2D textures piled up, forming a 3D cube of data. Its usage is an extended concept from the general texture class, tailored particularly for three-dimensional scenarios. For a more in-depth look on what all you can do with Texture3D in Unity, you can always check out the [official Unity Texture3D documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture3D.html).

properties:

    summary: |
      The 'depth' property refers to the third dimension of the 3D texture. It lets you know how many layers deep the texture is. For more details, check out the [Unity Texture3D.depth documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture3D-depth.html).

    summary: |
      The 'isReadable' property tells you if the Texture3D data can be read or not. To know more about this property, refer to the [Unity Texture3D.isReadable documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture3D-isReadable.html).

methods:
  - name: Apply
    summary: |
      The 'Apply' method is used to apply all previous set pixel and color changes. You can specify whether to update mipmap levels and if the texture should become unreadable after applying changes. For a detailed explanation, see the [Unity Texture3D.Apply documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture3D.Apply.html).

    parameters:
      - name: updateMipmaps
        type: boolean
        default:
        summary: If set to true, the mipmap levels are recalculated.
      - name: makeNoLongerReadable
        type: boolean
        default:
        summary: If true, the texture becomes unreadable to save memory after application.
    returns:
      - type: void
        summary:
  - name: SetPixel
    summary: |
      The 'SetPixel' method allows you to modify a pixel color at the specified position in the texture. It takes the position coordinates and new color as parameters. For more information, consult the [Unity Texture3D.SetPixel documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture3D.SetPixel.html).

        summary: The horizontal coordinate of the pixel.
      - name: y
        type: number
        default:
        summary: The vertical coordinate of the pixel.
      - name: z
        type: number
        default:
        summary: The depth coordinate of the pixel.
      - name: color
        type: DataType.Color
        default:
        summary: The new color of the pixel.
    returns:
      - type: void
        summary:
  - name: GetPixel
    summary: |
      The 'GetPixel' method retrieves the color of a specific pixel at the provided location within the texture. More details can be found in the [Unity Texture3D.GetPixel documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture3D.GetPixel.html).

        default:
        summary: The vertical coordinate of the pixel.
      - name: z

        default:
        summary: The depth coordinate of the pixel.
    returns:
      - type: DataType.Color
        summary: Returns the color of the pixel at the specified coordinates.
  - name: GetPixelBilinear
    summary: |
      The 'GetPixelBilinear' method fetches the color of a pixel using bilinear interpolation from the coordinates provided. This can give smoother results when fetching colors from textures. Refer to the [Unity Texture3D.GetPixelBilinear documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture3D.GetPixelBilinear.html) for a comprehensive understanding.
