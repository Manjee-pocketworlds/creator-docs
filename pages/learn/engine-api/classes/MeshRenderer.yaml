name: MeshRenderer
type: classes
summary: |
  MeshRenderer is a component class in Unity's rendering system that takes the geometry from the Mesh Filter and renders it at the position defined by the object's Transform component. You can change a GameObject's Material properties via the MeshRenderer. The MeshRenderer works in conjunction with the Mesh Filter for rendering of 3D objects. Further information can be found in [Unity's MeshRenderer Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/MeshRenderer.html).

    summary: |
      The additionalVertexStreams property is a Mesh that contains additional vertex data Streams. It is a highly advanced property that should be used with Shader Inputs that are expecting to receive this data. More can be found in [documentation link](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/MeshRenderer-additionalVertexStreams.html).

  - name: enlightenVertexStream
    summary: |
      The enlightenVertexStream property provides a Mesh that has the Enlighten data Vertex Stream. Enlighten is the lighting system used in Unity's Render to provide Real-time Global Illumination. For more details, refer to [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/MeshRenderer-enlightenVertexStream.html).

  - name: subMeshStartIndex
    summary: |
      The subMeshStartIndex of a mesh represents the first index of the submesh within the MeshRenderer. Submeshes are subsets of a mesh, and are often used to apply different materials to different parts of a mesh. Further details can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/MeshRenderer-subMeshStartIndex.html).
