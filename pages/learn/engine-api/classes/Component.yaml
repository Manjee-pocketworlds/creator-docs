name: Component
type: classes
summary: |
  A Component in Unity represents a piece of behavior or functionality that can be added to a GameObject. They are the building blocks of all Unity projects and dictate how a GameObject behaves in your game. Examples of components include Physics components such as Collider, rendering components like MeshRenderer and Camera, and custom behavior scripts, among many others. For more information, refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.html).

properties:
  - name: transform
    summary: |
      The 'transform' property gives you a handle to the Transform component of the GameObject to which this component is attached. The Transform component controls the position, rotation, and scale of a GameObject in the scene. Check out the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component-transform.html) for more information.

  - name: gameObject
    summary: |
      The 'gameObject' property allows you to access the GameObject that this component is attached to. Many operations in Unity involve manipulating GameObjects, often via the components attached to them. For more details, refer to the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component-gameObject.html).

    type: Class.GameObject
  - name: tag
    summary: |
      The 'tag' property gives you access to the tag of the GameObject this component is attached to. A GameObject can be tagged with a label allowing it to be easily identified and selected within the development environment. For more information, see the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component-tag.html).

    type: string
methods:
  - name: GetComponent
    summary: |
      The 'GetComponent' method is used to retrieve a component of a specified type, if it exists, from the GameObject to which this component is attached. For example, if your GameObject has a Rigidbody component attached, you can retrieve it using this method. Refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.GetComponent.html) for more details.

    code_samples:
    parameters:
      - name: type
        type: Class.Type
        default:
        summary: The type of component to retrieve.
    returns:
      - type: Class.Component
        summary: Returns the requested component if it exists on the GameObject.
  - name: GetComponentInChildren
    summary: |
      The 'GetComponentInChildren' method retrieves the specified component type from the first child of the GameObject this component is attached to. This is useful when you need to manipulate a specific component present in one of the GameObject's child objects. More details can be found in the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.GetComponentInChildren.html).

    code_samples:
    parameters:
      - name: t
        type: Class.Type
        default:
        summary: The type of component to retrieve from child GameObjects.
      - name: includeInactive
        type: boolean
        default:
        summary: If set to true, this method will also search within inactive GameObjects.
    returns:
      - type: Class.Component
        summary: Returns the requested component from child GameObjects if it exists.
  - name: GetComponentInParent
    summary: |
      The 'GetComponentInParent' method works similarly to 'GetComponentInChildren', but instead of searching for the component in children of the GameObject, it looks for it in the parents of the GameObject. For more information, check out the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.GetComponentInParent.html).

    parameters:
      - name: t
        type: Class.Type
        default:
        summary: The type of component to retrieve from parent GameObjects.
      - name: includeInactive
        type: boolean
        default:
        summary: If true, this method will also search within inactive GameObjects.
    returns:
      - type: Class.Component
        summary: Returns the requested component from parent GameObjects if it exists.
  - name: CompareTag
    summary: |
      The 'CompareTag' method is useful for comparing if the GameObject's tag matches a specified string. It can be used to differentiate behavior among different groups of GameObjects or implement specific logic based on tags. For more information, refer to the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.CompareTag.html).

      - name: tag
        type: string
        default:
        summary: The tag to compare with the GameObject's tag.
    returns:
      - type: boolean
        summary: Returns true if the GameObject's tag matches the specified string, false otherwise.
